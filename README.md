# Brooke Neupert's Webpage
Hi, my name is Brooke and this is my website! 

## Update 9-18-24
**What I worked on last Week:**
Last week, I found a suitable API for my project, and figured out how to access and use the data. I also created a project repo, and began importing resources and older projects to reference. 

**What I will work on this week:**
This week I am working on coding my website and building a basic HTML site and using Flask. I will work on getting the basic functionalities of the website designed and implemented before working on the design, so I will start with the database and upating it with the API data. I am also focusing on adding projects to my github page. 

**Obstacles and Impediments**
Time constraints are less of an issue this week, but I do have an exam to study for that could dig into that time. 

**How to Improve Workflow**
I tend to think visually, so I want to create a visual timeline for this project that I can follow as I work through the different steps. I think this will help motivate me to stay on track!
