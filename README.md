# Brooke Neupert's Webpage
Hi, my name is Brooke and this is my website! 

## Update 09/12/2024
- __What did you do last week?__ Last week, I created this website and took some time to play around with different project ideas. I realized that a lot of the careers that I will want to pursue require me to use large datasets of astronomy data or imaging data for different kinds of astronomical objects. I also really want to learn more about frontend design, so I'm thinking of doing a project that will:

 1. Allow me to create a website
 2. Use data from a NASA (or other observatory) database to look at trends surrounding a specific phenomenon
 3. Create a page visualizing or simulating the phenomenon so users can better understand the significance of the phenomenon.

- __What do you plan to do this week?__ This week I will be exploring databases to find any that seem especially interesting, and figure out how to use and update that data. I will also get started on writing the skeleton for my website.
  
- __Are there any impediments in your way?__ Time constraints due to commitments for other classes, and difficulties deciding on what kinds of phenomena I'm really interested in studying. I also want to find good resources for creating elegant and intuitive websites from scratch.

- __Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?__ Last week my process was a little scattered- I was a bit confused about how to set up my Pages website (this one) and that took longer than I would have preferred. However, I did like my system of scheduling certain tasks for specific dates and times. For example, I scheduled time to work on finding a database this week on Wednesday at 2:00pm, which was nice! Going forward, I am going to schedule more time for new things though to give myself the extra space to figure it out first.
