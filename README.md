# Brooke Neupert's Webpage
Hi, my name is Brooke and this is my website! 

## Update 9-18-24
**What I worked on last Week:**
Last week, I found a suitable API for my project, and figured out how to access and use the data. I also created a project repo, and began importing resources and older projects to reference. 

**What I will work on this week:**
This week I am working on coding my website and building a basic HTML site and using Flask. I will work on getting the basic functionalities of the website designed and implemented before working on the design, so I will start with the database and upating it with the API data. I am also focusing on adding projects to my github page. 

**Obstacles and Impediments**
Time constraints are less of an issue this week, but I do have an exam to study for that could dig into that time. 

**How to Improve Workflow**
I tend to think visually, so I want to create a visual timeline for this project that I can follow as I work through the different steps. I think this will help motivate me to stay on track!


## Update 10-3-24
**What I worked (for the last 2) Weeks:**
I forgot to post last week so over the past two weeks I have done more research into the best tools to build my website, and found that React JS is popular for this sort of application! As such, I have been working through some mini React exercises and tutorials to help familiarize myself with the code. I applied for a few full-time positions this week, and I also went to the career fair in Boulder yesterday.I made some good connections and met new employers that were hiring for full time positions.

**What I will work on this week:**
This week I will work on getting my website wireframes done before using react, css, etc. to build the website. If I have time I would also like to test the API and streamline the process of getting information from it.

**Obstacles and Impediments**
The usual culprits, lots of course work and job applications to take up time in the next week!

**How to Improve Workflow**
I was a little scattered last week, and sort of got caught up in learning a new skill. Although I am excited to get to use React, I need to remember to be focused on my goals with the project more rather than doing a bunch of related "sidequests". I do feel like I have built up a good toolkit of skills that I will be able to put to good use in this project!
